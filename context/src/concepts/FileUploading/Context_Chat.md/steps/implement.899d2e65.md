# implement: based on the additional directions, implement additional functionality in the file uploading concept. respond with only the additions or modifications you've made, not the entire file. If somehting is not possible to do, notify me in the test before the code.

one note on the directions:

I don't need a purpose file. On confirmation file is uploaded, give back an id for the file or something. Then I will get that id and call and get file's contents. That is how I will get the file that has just been imported. The user can't upload irrelevant files otherwise.
