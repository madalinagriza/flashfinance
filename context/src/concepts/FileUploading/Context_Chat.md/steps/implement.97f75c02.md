# implement: If I want the content of the csv file that is uploaded to be triggering Transaction.importcsv...

what functions in the fileuploading concept needs to return the file id so that I can call get filename content?

if things need to be slightly reworked in the code, you can propose a change.

first give me explanations, then paste code.
