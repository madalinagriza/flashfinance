# prompt: Implement a testcase that showcases the normal operational principle of Label. Consult the spec for seeing the actions and understand how Label can be used. Consult the Label Implementation to retrieve the right calls, and the label-clear.ts testfile for seeing how to format data for tests, and the example testcases to see how verifying results should go. Test no suggest AI-features, just the actions. Nothing needs to be changed in label.ts, use the functions as is. If there is something crucially wrong in this, mention outside the code but keep the code with the existing functions and imports.

[Label Implementation](src\concepts\FlashFinance\Label\label.ts)
[Label AI tests](src/concepts/FlashFinance/Label/test/label-clear.ts)
