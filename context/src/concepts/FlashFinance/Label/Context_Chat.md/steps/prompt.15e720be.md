# prompt: paste all the text in the contexts that you see attached. split the text by the source file . you can say explicitly if you don't see the contents of the file. there's no need to imagine what these files could look like. be factual and precise. your output must directly match the linked files. I need all files attached to be reflected in the output, if you can't access a file you should indicate so.
