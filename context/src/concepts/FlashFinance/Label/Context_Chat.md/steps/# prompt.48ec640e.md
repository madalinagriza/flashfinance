# # prompt: Implement a testcase that showcases the normal operational principle of Label. Consult the spec for seeing the actions and understand how Label can be used. Consult the Label Implementation to retrieve the right calls, and the label-clear.ts testfile for seeing how to format data for tests, and the example testcases to see how verifying results should go. Test no suggest AI-features, just the actions. Nothing needs to be changed in label.ts, use the functions as is. Utilize the structure of the example testcase, in terms of asserting and setting up testcases. Make minimal tescases, demonstrating full functionality.
