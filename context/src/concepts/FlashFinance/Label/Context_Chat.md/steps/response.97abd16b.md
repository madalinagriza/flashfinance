# response:

No, I cannot access local files on your computer.

The link you provided, `[Label Implementation](src\concepts\FlashFinance\Label\label.ts)`, points to a local file path on your machine, not a public web URL that I can access.

However, I can absolutely read and understand `.ts` (TypeScript) files. If you **paste the code** from that file into the chat, I will be able to work with it.
