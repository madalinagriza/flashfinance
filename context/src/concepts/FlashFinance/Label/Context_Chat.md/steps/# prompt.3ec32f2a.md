# # prompt: Implement a testcase that showcases the normal operational principle of Label. Consult the spec for seeing the actions and understand how Label can be used. Consult the Label Implementation to retrieve the right calls, and the label-clear.ts testfile for seeing how to format data for tests, and the example testcases to see how verifying results should go. Test no suggest AI-features, just the actions. Nothing needs to be changed in label.ts, use the functions as is. Utilize the structure of the example testcase, in terms of asserting and setting up testcases. Make minimal tescases, demonstrating full functionality. Double check and include classes and the class's functions with the names their are defined as, don't compose other names. You should have everything necessary from label.ts to setup a testcase. Consult test/label-clear.ts for anything from Label you might now know how to demonstrate. And tell me if you don't have access to a certain file or if the file I added as a context appears to be empty;
