# prompt:   implement the state for the user spec. use label.ts to consult imports and structure. . draw from existing knowledge how to implement user concepts. Keep it simple, minimal, and just the amounts that we need. Don't implement any actions, just the state. Don't be concerned about the actions, just the fields we would need in the class to satisfy the state. Take as an example the code in label.ts. Don't interleave any functions or classes from label, but follow it for imports, class structure, seeing how to call mongodb and other particularities. Be minimal in your code.

**concept:** User\[ID]

**purpose:**\
establish a unique identity for each person and control access to app functionality so that data is isolated per account

**principle:**\
when a user chooses a category for a transaction, they create a label linking that transaction to the chosen category, making its purpose explicit in their records.
if the user stages labels and then finalizes, each transaction gains exactly one active label reflecting that choice; if the user cancels, no labels are applied.
suggestions may inform staging but never change state until finalized.\
**state:**

> a set of Users with
>
> > a user\_id ID\
> > an email String\
> > a name String\
> > a password\_hash String\
> > a status {ACTIVE | INACTIVE}

**actions:**

> register(email: String, name: String, password: String): (user: User)
>
> > *requires:*\
> > email is not used by any existing user\
> > *effects:*\
> > creates a new user with a fresh user\_id, password\_hash derived from password, status ACTIVE; adds the user to Users; returns the created user

> authenticate(email: String, password: String): (user: User)
>
> > *requires:*\
> > there exists a user with the given email whose password\_hash matches password and whose status is ACTIVE\
> > *effects:*\
> > returns that user

> deactivate(user\_id: ID)
>
> > *requires:*\
> > a user with user\_id exists\
> > *effects:*\
> > sets the user's status to INACTIVE

> changePassword(user\_id: ID, old\_password: String, new\_password: String): (ok: Boolean)
>
> > *requires:*\
> > a user with user\_id exists and old\_password matches the stored password\_hash\
> > *effects:*\
> > updates password\_hash with new\_password; returns true

**invariants:**

* email uniquely identifies a single user
* user\_id is unique and never reused
