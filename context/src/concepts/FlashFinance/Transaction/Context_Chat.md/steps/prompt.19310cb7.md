# prompt:  iterate on transaction.ts to implement the mark\_labeled action. use label.ts to consult imports and structure.   Keep it simple, minimal, and just the amounts that we need. Don't implement any actions, just the state. implement any getters you might need but be minimal in your design. Take as an example the code in label.ts. Don't interleave any functions or classes from label, but follow it for imports, class structure, seeing how to call mongodb and other particularities. Be minimal in your code.
