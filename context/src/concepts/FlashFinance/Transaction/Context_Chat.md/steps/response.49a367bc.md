# response:

To implement the state for the `Transaction` concept, we will define the `Id` class (mimicking its definition in `label.ts` to adhere to "follow it for imports, class structure" while respecting "Don't interleave any functions or classes from label"), an enum for the transaction status, the MongoDB document structure, and a `TransactionStore` class to hold the collection of these transaction documents.

This implementation focuses strictly on defining the necessary types and the store structure for the state, without including any actions, as requested.

```typescript
// deno-lint-ignore no-unversioned-import
import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";

// The Id class, defined similarly to label.ts, to satisfy the
// `tx_id ID` and `owner_id ID` types mentioned in the specification
// while not directly importing from label.ts. In a real-world
// application, this common utility would reside in a shared file.
export class Id {
  private constructor(private value: string) {}

  static from(value: string): Id {
    return new Id(value);
  }

  toString(): string {
    return this.value;
  }
}

// Prefix for MongoDB collection names, following the pattern in label.ts
const PREFIX = "Transaction" + ".";

// Defines the possible statuses for a transaction as specified
export enum TransactionStatus {
  UNLABELED = "UNLABELED",
  LABELED = "LABELED",
}

// Defines the MongoDB document structure for a single transaction record.
// This directly represents the "state" of each transaction as described
// in the prompt. The _id field is typically the primary key in MongoDB,
// here assumed to be the globally unique tx_id for simplicity.
export type TransactionDoc = {
  _id: string; // The primary key for MongoDB, typically mirrors tx_id
  tx_id: string; // Unique identifier for the transaction
  owner_id: string; // Identifier for the user who owns this transaction
  date: Date; // The date of the transaction
  merchant_text: string; // Description of the merchant
  amount: number; // The transaction amount
  status: TransactionStatus; // Current labeling status of the transaction
};

// The TransactionStore class manages the collection of TransactionDoc records.
// It sets up the connection to the specific MongoDB collection for transactions.
// This class represents the "set of Transactions" mentioned in the state.
export class TransactionStore {
  private transactions: Collection<TransactionDoc>;

  // The constructor initializes the MongoDB collection using the provided Db instance.
  constructor(private readonly db: Db) {
    this.transactions = db.collection(PREFIX + "transactions");
  }

  // No actions are implemented here, as per the prompt's instruction to
  // focus only on the state fields and class structure.
}
```
