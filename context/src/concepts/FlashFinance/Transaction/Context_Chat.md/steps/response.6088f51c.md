# response:

To implement the "rename concept" for `transaction.ts` while adhering to the principles of `label.ts` for structure and minimalism, we will focus on defining the transaction's state and adding a single, essential getter.

The `Id` class is kept separate from `label.ts` as per the instruction to avoid interleaving, and its role as a common utility is noted.

**Changes made:**

1. **`TransactionStatus` Enum:** Defined the two required statuses (`UNLABELED` and `LABELED`) as an enum for type safety.
2. **`TransactionDoc` Type:** Created a type alias `TransactionDoc` that directly maps to the specified state fields: `tx_id`, `owner_id`, `date`, `merchant_text`, `amount`, and `status`. The `_id` field for MongoDB is set to mirror `tx_id` for simple retrieval.
3. **`TransactionStore` Class:**
   * The constructor initializes a MongoDB `Collection<TransactionDoc>` named `transaction.transactions`, following the naming convention from `label.ts`.
   * A minimal getter `getTransaction` is added. This allows retrieving a single `TransactionDoc` by its `tx_id`, which is a fundamental operation for accessing the state of a specific transaction.

```typescript
import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";

// The Id class, defined similarly to label.ts, to satisfy the
// `tx_id ID` and `owner_id ID` types mentioned in the specification
// while not directly importing from label.ts. In a real-world
// application, this common utility would reside in a shared file.
export class Id {
  private constructor(private value: string) {}

  static from(value: string): Id {
    return new Id(value);
  }

  toString(): string {
    return this.value;
  }
}

// Prefix for MongoDB collection names, following the pattern in label.ts
const PREFIX = "Transaction" + ".";

// Defines the possible statuses for a transaction as specified
export enum TransactionStatus {
  UNLABELED = "UNLABELED",
  LABELED = "LABELED",
}

// Defines the MongoDB document structure for a single transaction record.
// This directly represents the "state" of each transaction as described
// in the prompt. The _id field is typically the primary key in MongoDB,
// here assumed to be the globally unique tx_id for simplicity.
export type TransactionDoc = {
  _id: string; // The primary key for MongoDB, typically mirrors tx_id
  tx_id: string; // Unique identifier for the transaction
  owner_id: string; // Identifier for the user who owns this transaction
  date: Date; // The date of the transaction
  merchant_text: string; // Description of the merchant
  amount: number; // The transaction amount
  status: TransactionStatus; // Current labeling status of the transaction
};

// The TransactionStore class manages the collection of TransactionDoc records.
// It sets up the connection to the specific MongoDB collection for transactions.
// This class represents the "set of Transactions" mentioned in the state.
export class TransactionStore {
  private transactions: Collection<TransactionDoc>;

  // The constructor initializes the MongoDB collection using the provided Db instance.
  constructor(private readonly db: Db) {
    this.transactions = db.collection(PREFIX + "transactions");
  }

  // Minimal getter to retrieve a single transaction by its ID.
  // This adheres to the "minimal getters" requirement, providing access
  // to the defined state without implementing any actions.
  async getTransaction(tx_id: Id): Promise<TransactionDoc | null> {
    return await this.transactions.findOne({ _id: tx_id.toString() });
  }

  // No actions are implemented here, as per the prompt's instruction to
  // focus only on the state fields and class structure.
}
```
