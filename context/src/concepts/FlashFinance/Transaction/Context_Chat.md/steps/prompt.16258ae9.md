# prompt:  Create a new test file named `transaction_parse.test.ts` to verify that the TransactionStore’s parsing correctly extracts and filters transactions from the provided `sample_spendings.csv`. Assume the CSV columns vary by naming conventions (some may be called ‘transaction date’, ‘posting date’, ‘amount’, ‘debit’, ‘credit’, ‘merchant name’, ‘description’, etc.), so the test should not depend on specific header text but should instead verify outcomes: that only valid ‘spending’ or cost transactions are returned, that their amounts are positive, and that inflows (deposits/refunds) are excluded. Use Deno’s built-in test framework and import assertions from `jsr:@std/assert`. Set up a lightweight in-memory or mock database object (or stub collection) to instantiate TransactionStore without a real connection. Read the CSV using `Deno.readTextFile("sample/sample_spendings.csv")`, call `parse_info` on it, and check that the result array includes several parsed transactions with reasonable values (positive amounts, dates parsed where available, merchant text not empty). Then add another test that calls `import_transactions` using the same CSV and confirms that each returned TransactionDoc corresponds to a valid parsed entry, has a generated tx\_id, matches the owner\_id, and that inflows were skipped. Do not assert specific merchant names or dates—assert the structural and logical correctness of the parsed output (positive amounts, cost-only rows, optional date and merchant fields). Keep the test minimal, no external I/O beyond reading the CSV file.
