# prompt:  Create a single Deno test file `transaction_parse.test.ts` that uses the existing `sample/sample-spendings.csv` to validate the end-to-end flow without relying on specific header names: read the CSV from disk, call the parser to extract transactions (treating columns as unknown and possibly labeled with synonyms like dates, merchants, debits/credits, generic amounts), then call `import_transactions(owner_id, csvContent)` to persist only cost/outflow rows (amount > 0) and skip inflows; after importing, use a minimal getter you add to `TransactionStore` (e.g., `list_all(): Promise<TransactionDoc[]>`) that returns all stored transactions from the collection so the test can assert they were imported correctly; keep assertions structural and logical (counts match, every amount is a positive number, merchant text is optional but trimmed if present, dates parse when available but may be null/undefined), avoid asserting exact header strings or specific merchant names/dates; use Deno’s built-in test runner and `jsr:@std/assert` only, no extra libraries; use Deno’s CSV parser (`npm:@std/csv/parse`) inside your implementation, normalize headers by uppercasing and stripping punctuation/whitespace, prefer explicit debit columns over credit, treat credit/CR/positive credit as inflow to skip, and for single “amount” columns use sign or DR/CR type to decide; do not add or modify any state or actions beyond introducing the minimal `list_all` getter, do not expose new public parse APIs beyond what already exists, and keep the test hermetic with a testDb
