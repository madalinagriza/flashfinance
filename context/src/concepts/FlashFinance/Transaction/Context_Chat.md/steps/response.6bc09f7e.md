# response:

The `test-parsing-edge-cases.ts` file dynamically creates most of the necessary CSV content for its tests using the `createTempCsvFile` helper. This means `empty.csv`, `headers-only.csv`, `inflows-only.csv`, `zero-negative-amounts.csv`, and `missing-amount-col.csv` are generated on the fly and cleaned up.

However, the `test-parsing-edge-cases.ts` file references `TESTS_CSV_PATH` which points to `./sample/testsample.csv` and reads it directly. The `testsample.csv` content provided in the prompt was inconsistent with the `expectedTxDetails` defined in the test. To ensure the test passes correctly, `testsample.csv` needs to be updated.

Here is the corrected content for `src/concepts/FlashFinance/Transaction/test-actions/sample/testsample.csv`, which aligns with the 7 expected outflow transactions in `test-parsing-edge-cases.ts`:

***

### File: `src/concepts/FlashFinance/Transaction/test-actions/sample/testsample.csv`

```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Type,Extra Column
2024-03-01,Coffee Shop,5.00,DR,SomeData
INVALID_DATE,Hardware Store,25.00,DR,MoreData
2024-03-02,Parking Meter,1.50,DR,EvenMoreData
,Lunch,12.00,DR,LastData
2024-03-05,Credit Card Payment,-500.00,CR,
2024-03-06,Online Subscription,15.00,CR,
2024-03-08,Dividends,100.00,DR,
2024-03-09,Book Store,20.00,DR,
2024-03-10,Restaurant,75.00,CR,
2024-03-11,Salary,3000.00,CR,
2024-03-12,Extra Col,10.00,DR,
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* The line `2024-03-07,ATM Withdrawal,20.00,DR,` was removed, as it was an additional outflow not present in the test's `expectedTxDetails`.
* The line `2024-03-08,Dividends,-100.00,CR,` was modified to `2024-03-08,Dividends,100.00,DR,`.
  * Previously, `-100.00` in a `CR` (credit) column or with a `CR` type would be skipped as an inflow or a negative value.
  * The test's `expectedTxDetails` lists `Dividends` with an `amount: 100.00`. Changing the type to `DR` (debit) and making the amount positive `100.00` correctly designates it as an outflow.
* The line `2024-03-13,Gas Station,40.00,DR,` was removed, as it was an additional outflow not present in the test's `expectedTxDetails`.

With these changes, `testsample.csv` will now correctly yield 7 outflow transactions matching the `expectedTxDetails` in `test-parsing-edge-cases.ts`.

The other CSV files mentioned in `test-parsing-edge-cases.ts` have their content explicitly defined within the `createTempCsvFile` calls in the test file itself:

* **`EMPTY_CSV_PATH`**: `""`
* **`HEADERS_ONLY_CSV_PATH`**: `"Date,Description,Amount"`
* **`INFLOWS_ONLY_CSV_PATH`**:
  ```csv
  Date,Description,Debit,Credit,Type
  2024-01-01,Deposit,,100.00,CR
  2024-01-02,Refund from Amazon,-50.00,,DR
  2024-01-03,Salary Deposit,,2500.00,CR
  2024-01-04,Generic Inflow Amount,-75.00,,
  ```
* **`ZERO_NEGATIVE_AMOUNTS_CSV_PATH`**:
  ```csv
  Date,Description,Debit,Type
  2024-01-01,Zero Purchase,0.00,DR
  2024-01-02,Negative Debit,-15.00,DR
  2024-01-03,Zero Generic Amount,0.00,
  ```
* **`MISSING_AMOUNT_COL_CSV_PATH`**:
  ```csv
  Date,Description
  2024-01-01,Just a description
  2024-01-02,Another description
  ```

These temporary files are created and removed by the test framework itself, so they do not need to be created as static files.
