# prompt:  implement the state for the transaction spec. use label.ts to consult imports and structure.  draw from existing knowledge how to implement user concepts. Keep it simple, minimal, and just the amounts that we need. Don't implement any actions, just the state. Don't be concerned about the actions, just the fields we would need in the class to satisfy the state. Take as an example the code in label.ts. Don't interleave any functions or classes from label, but follow it for imports, class structure, seeing how to call mongodb and other particularities. Be minimal in your code.
