// `tx_id ID` and `owner_id ID` types mentioned in the specification
// while not directly importing from label.ts. In a real-world
// application, this common utility would reside in a shared file.

// This directly represents the "state" of each transaction as described
// in the prompt. The _id field is typically the primary key in MongoDB,
// here assumed to be the globally unique tx_id for simplicity.
export type TransactionDoc = {

  tx_id: string; // Unique identifier for the transaction
  owner_id: string; // Identifier for the user who owns this transaction
  date: Date; // The date of the transaction
  merchant_text: string; // Description of the merchant
  amount: number; // The transaction amount
  status: TransactionStatus; // Current labeling status of the transaction
};

// The TransactionStore class manages the collection of TransactionDoc records.
// It sets up the connection to the specific MongoDB collection for transactions.
// This class represents the "set of Transactions" mentioned in the state.

  private transactions: Collection<TransactionDoc>;

  // focus only on the state fields and class structure.
