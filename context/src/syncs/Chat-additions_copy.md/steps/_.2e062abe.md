# Passthrough Routes

By default, the Requesting concept exposes concept actions directly in the form of **passthrough routes**. This means that HTTP requests against paths of the form:

```js
// Format: route = {base URL}/{concept}/{action or query}
route = "/api/LikertSurvey/createSurvey"
```

will automatically passthrough to the underlying concept action or query: in this case, `LikertSurvey.createSurvey`.

* The request verb must be `POST`
* The request body is a single JSON record of the specified shape in the concept specification
* The return body will also be a single JSON record of the specified shape

For example, if the concept specification has:

```concept
actions
  createSurvey (author: Author, title: String, scaleMin: Number, scaleMax: Number): (survey: Survey)
    ...
```

then the body of a request would look like:

```json
{
  "author": "me",
  "title": "Mangos",
  "scaleMin": 1,
  "scaleMax": 5
}
```

with a return of:

```json
{
  "survey": "019a22d2-e485-71b4-a668-e7d9e8859b15"
}
```
