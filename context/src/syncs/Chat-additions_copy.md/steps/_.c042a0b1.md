# similarly to how label concept does finalize, working with a bulk of transactions,

1. I need you to implement Category.bulk\_add\_transaction which calls Category.add\_transaction in parallel for all the transactions. It awaits all of them to finish and throws an error if there was an error in at least of one of them. I would not want a sequential waiting.

2. With similar requirements, I need you to implement Transaction.bulk\_mark\_labeled which takes the same arguments as mark\_labeled, but it's a list of transaction ids. And it behaves similarly to #1.
