# solution:

The solution is to correct the `path` in the `when` clause of the `GetUnlabeledTransactionsRequest` synchronization to match the actual request path generated by the `Requesting` concept's passthrough mechanism. I will also correct the path for the `ImportTransactionsRequest` sync to prevent future issues.

The corrected file is below.
