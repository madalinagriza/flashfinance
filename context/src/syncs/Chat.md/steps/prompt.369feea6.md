# prompt: I added a new function whiich moves the transaciton from category to another (inside the mody). I need to update the syncs. I dont want to expose an add transaction sync or a remove transaction sync, I want there to be an updateTransaction sync which calls it. Can you tell me what to remove in the category sync, as well as make a new sync with requests and resposne for updateTransaction ? Only give me modified, removed, or added functions/syncs
