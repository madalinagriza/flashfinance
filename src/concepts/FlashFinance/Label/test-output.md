## Operational Principle Tests (from `test-op-simple.ts`)
These tests validate the **core lifecycle of labels**, following the concept’s operational principle of **staging → finalizing → updating → removing** in a consistent and atomic manner:

1. **Stage–Finalize–Update–Remove Lifecycle** — confirms that a user can stage a label (draft), finalize it (commit to active state), update it (change category), and remove it (trash).  
   Ensures proper state transitions between *staged*, *finalized*, and *removed* states for labels tied to user transactions.  
2. **Conflict Handling and Atomicity** — tests that staging is correctly rejected when a committed or staged label already exists, that finalization is atomic (commits all or none), and that cancelling clears staged data without committing unintended state.  
3. **Stage → Cancel → Re-Stage → Finalize Sequence** — validates that cancelling a staged label fully clears intermediate state, allowing a clean re-staging and successful finalization afterward.  
   This scenario ensures the correctness of transitions, clean rollbacks, and consistent persistence.

Together, these tests confirm that **LabelStore** maintains label integrity and supports predictable, transactional user operations.

---

## Additional Interesting Scenarios (from `test-non-popular.ts` and extensions)
1. **Finalize with Empty Staging (No-Op)** — verifies that calling `finalize` with no staged labels performs no operation and leaves state unchanged.  
   This scenario demonstrates graceful handling of *empty actions*, ensuring robustness under benign user errors.  
2. **Duplicate Staging Rejection** — tests that attempting to `stage` the same `(user, tx_id)` twice is correctly rejected, preventing inconsistent label states and enforcing unique transaction ownership.  
3. **Reversible Label Workflow (Stage → Cancel → Re-Stage → Finalize)** — reconfirms that cancelling fully resets intermediate staged labels, allowing users to restart the labeling process without residual conflicts.  
   Validates the design principle of *clean state recovery* between staged operations.  
4. **Conflict Resolution Across States** *(from `test-op-simple`)* — implicitly tested through the atomicity checks: when both a staged and committed label exist for a transaction, the correct one takes precedence and others are blocked.  
   This ensures per-user consistency and enforces strong invariants in multi-step labeling actions.

---

Overall, these tests collectively ensure that the **Label** concept correctly enforces:
- **atomic operations** (no partial commits),
- **conflict prevention** (unique active/staged labels per transaction),
- **clean rollbacks** (via cancel and re-stage), and
- **graceful handling of edge conditions** (empty finalize, duplicate stage).  

They validate the robustness of LabelStore under both normal and boundary conditions, proving adherence to the concept’s principle of *staged, transactional label management*.
