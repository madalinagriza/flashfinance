# prompt:   Implement a testcase that verifies that a user can successfully deactivate their account, reactivate it with a new password, and then authenticate using that new password. Consult the `UserConcept` implementation for correct method calls, and use `test-op-simple.ts` for structure, imports, and assertion style. The test should only demonstrate the required behavior: (1) the user registers, (2) deactivates successfully, (3) fails to authenticate while inactive, (4) reactivates with a new password, and (5) successfully authenticates with that new password. Use `await assertRejects` to confirm the authentication fails while inactive, and `assertExists` or `assertEquals` to verify the successful reactivation and authentication afterward. Do not add unrelated assertions or checks. Keep the test minimal — include only the necessary data and calls to demonstrate the deactivate–reactivate–authenticate flow. Place it as a new `Deno.test` in `test-non-popular.ts`.
