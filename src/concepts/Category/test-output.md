# Output Summary by AI
## Operational Principle Tests (from `test-op-simple.ts`)
These verify the core required actions of the **Category** concept:
1. **create** — ensures per-owner name uniqueness and correct creation behavior.  
2. **rename** — enforces name uniqueness and allows idempotent renaming.  
3. **delete** — allows deletion only if not referenced by labels.  
4. **metrics lifecycle** — validates `setMetricTotal`, `getMetric`, `listMetrics`, and metric cleanup on category deletion.  

## Additional Interesting Scenarios (from this file)
1. **Renaming with Metrics** — verifies that renaming a category does not alter or break existing CategoryMetrics.  
2. **Cross-Owner Isolation** — ensures categories and their metrics are isolated per owner, even if names match.  
3. **Independent Metric Deletion** — confirms `deleteMetricsForCategory` correctly removes all metrics for a category and returns the deleted count.  

Together, these tests provide broader confidence that the **Category** concept maintains consistency,  
owner isolation, and metric integrity beyond the core operational principle tests.
