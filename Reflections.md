### *What was hard or easy?*

Getting UI function was quite challenging (and frustrating). Weirdly enough, integrating syncs felt easier since tracing the calls at least made it clear where things failed.

### *What went well?*
 
I like how my webpage looks! I had to learn to be very specific about what I want when prompting the AI. Sometimes I didn't know it myself, but it forced me to thing about the details, not only the general stuff.

### *What mistakes did you make, and how would you avoid making them in the future? *

Lots of formating inconsistenties. I think accross my codebase now the style is a random mix between camelcase vs snake case (I apologize in advance lol). Really planning to fix these styles some time after.

### *What skills did you acquire and which do you feel you still need to develop further? *

On the same note as above, concept design showed me how thinking about stuff in advance really can remove so much friction during development. Things like style, format of output, concepts themselves streamline the process.

### *How did you use the Context tool?* 

Was very good when I had to write new content and new files. For syncs, when there was an error it'd be able to process all that tracing info and weed out the problem. 

### *How did you use an agentic coding tool? *

Lots of times for the UI stuff. In backend, if I made a change to the concept or reformatted a function, I'd use it to update my testcases in the background.

### *What conclusions would you draw about the appropriate role of LLMs in software development?*

They have their place and their uses. Vibe coding in parallel on the UI and the backend saves a lot of time. But there's also times you have to take on the reigns. I appreciated that this project did make and leave time for really thinking about design, offloading some more simpler busy-work stuff to the AI.
